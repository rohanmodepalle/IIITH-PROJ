/* 
input format
input -> num_stations, num_roads, num_ people
input -> station_names //this also adds vertices to the graph which is necessary
input -> enter all the bidirectional paths and the road lengths
input -> for all the number of people we had taken, accept their source stations
day 0 -> source_station
we can just assume simulation for increasing days until "simulation exit is pressed"
    our option window contains-
    1. List of covid positive people //which returns number of primary and secondary contact and their ids
    2. Gives shortest path and safest path between 2 stations....movement is also accepted to go to new destination
    3. Returns status of the person and the station of that day
    4. Go to next day or exit the simulation
when u go to next day, some carry ons are-
people who havent moved, stay in same station, hence the 'stable tansfer' function
all covid positive people day of recover = date-1
